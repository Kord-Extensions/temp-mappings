# Temporary (Mappings)

This is a temporary holding repository for the Kord Extensions mappings module, which we moved here because
[one of our core contributors cannot be contacted](https://github.com/orgs/Kord-Extensions/discussions/3#discussioncomment-10318475).

We'll move this into our mainline repository again once we've sorted things out.

# Important Note

This is simply a holding repository.
As it isn't meant to be built and used, we haven't restructured it or set up CI scripts.

If you need to use the mappings module in the meantime, we recommend you stick with Kord Extensions version 
`1.9.0-SNAPSHOT`.
